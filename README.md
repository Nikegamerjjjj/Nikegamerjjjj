Hello, I’m Nikita, 15 year old boy coding.

<br>

I've done coding for 2.5 years now (updated on December 29th, 2022), and begun in August 2020.

<br><br>

I’m interested in software and game development!
I’m currently working on miscellaneous projects, like [scratch-v](https://github.com/nikeedev/scratch-v), which is a code to connect to Turbowarp through websocket, to manage cloud variables inside Scratch projects 

<br>
I code in [V](https://github.com/vlang/v) and C++, aswell as i am learning them :)
