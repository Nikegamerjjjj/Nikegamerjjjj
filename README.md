Hi!

I’m Nikita, an 15 year old boy who writes text files like code for 2.8 years now and begun since August 2020.

I’m interested in creating programs, apps, game engines and other stuff for game development!
I also like exploring new programming languages

I’m currently working on various projects, most of them I'm working on are
shown in "repositories" page, as i usually don't update the pinned ones.

Used languages:
- C++ (mostly used)
- JavaScript (mostly used)
- C# (kinda used, check repos)
    
My favourite code editors and IDE's: 
Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio
