Hello, I’m Nikita, 15 year old boy coding.


I've done coding for 2.5 years now (updated on December 29th, 2022), and begun in August 2020.

I’m interested in software and game development!

I’m currently working on various projects, like [scratch-v](https://github.com/nikeedev/scratch-v), which is a code to connect to Turbowarp through websocket, to manage cloud variables inside Scratch projects.

I use V which has a lot like `gg` module to draw graphics, or `net` module which has websocket, http, fetch and a lot more, and many other modules.

<br>

I code in [V](https://github.com/vlang/v) and JS :)
