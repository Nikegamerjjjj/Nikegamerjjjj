Hi!

I’m Nikita, been coding since 12 yrs. old.

I’m interested in creating programs, apps, game engines and other tools for game development!
I also like exploring new programming languages

I’m working on various projects/software, most of them I'm working on are
shown in "repositories" page, as i usually often don't update the pinned ones on my profile page.

Used languages:
- JavaScript (mostly used)
- C++ (mostly used)
- Rust (used sometimes)
- V (used a lot)
- C# (kinda used...not a lot)
    
My favourite code editor and IDE are Visual Studio Code, neovim and as IDE I use Visual Studio. Both do a seamlessly good job
