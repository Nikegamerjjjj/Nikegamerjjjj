Hi!

I’m Nikita, an 15 year old boy, been coding for 2.5 years.

I’m interested in creating programs, apps, game engines and other tools for game development!
I also like exploring new programming languages

I’m working on various projects/software, most of them I'm working on are
shown in "repositories" page, as i usually often don't update the pinned ones.

Used languages:
- JavaScript (mostly used)
- V (used a lot)
- C++ (used a lot)
- Rust (thnking about to learn it)
- C# (kinda used...)
    
My favourite code editors and IDE's: 
Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio
