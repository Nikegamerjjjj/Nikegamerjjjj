Hello, I’m Nikita, 15 year old boy coding.

<br>

I've done coding for 2.5 years now (updated on December 29th, 2022), and begun in August 2020.
I’m interested in web and game development!
I’m currently working on mine C++ game engine: [Grass](https://github.com/nikeedev/grass) 


I code proudly in [V](https://github.com/vlang/v) and C++, aswell as i am learning them :)
